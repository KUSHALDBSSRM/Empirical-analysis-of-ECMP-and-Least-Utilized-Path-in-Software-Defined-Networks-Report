<h1> Empirical Analysis of Equal Cost Multipath Routing (ECMP) and Least Utilized Path Routing Algorithms (LUP) in Software Defined Networks (SDNs) </h1>
A detailed analysis is done using the various parameters like packet loss, and jitter to compare the performances of Equal Cost Multipath Routing (ECMP) and Least Utilized Path (LUP) Routing in Software Defined Networks using both TCP and UDP connections.
Fattree topology of data centers created using mininet. Pox controller is used to implement routing algorithms.
